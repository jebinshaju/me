## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A GitHub account.

### Forking and Cloning the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository**

   - Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this repository page to create a copy under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
     ```

     Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your forked repository (e.g., `your-username.github.io` if you plan to create a user site).

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

## Customization

To make this portfolio your own, you'll need to customize the content and images. Below are the detailed steps:

### **1. Update Personal Information**

Open the `index.html` file in a code editor and update the following:

- **Title Tag**

  ```html
  <title>Your Name</title>
  ```

- **Hero Section**

  ```html
  <h2>Your Name</h2>
  <p>I'm <span class="typed" data-typed-items="Your Profession, Your Skills, Your Role">Your Profession</span></p>
  ```

- **About Section**

  Update your personal details such as birthday, phone number, email, and location.

  ```html
  <li><i class="bi bi-chevron-right"></i> <strong>Birthday:</strong> <span>Your Birthday</span></li>
  <li><i class="bi bi-chevron-right"></i> <strong>Socials:</strong> <span><a href="http://yourwebsite.com">yourwebsite.com</a></span></li>
  <li><i class="bi bi-chevron-right"></i> <strong>Phone:</strong> <span>Your Phone Number</span></li>
  <li><i class="bi bi-chevron-right"></i> <strong>City:</strong> <span>Your City, Country</span></li>
  ```

### **2. Replace Images**

All images are located in the `assets/img/` directory. Replace the placeholder images with your own:

- **Profile Image**

  Replace `assets/img/profile-img.jpg` with your profile picture.

- **Hero Background**

  Replace `assets/img/hero-bg.jpg` with your desired background image.

  Replace images in `assets/img/projects/` with images of your own projects.

### **3. Customize Content**

  Update the paragraphs to describe yourself, your passions, and your goals.

  Update your education and professional experience. Ensure dates, titles, and descriptions are accurate.

  Adjust the skills and proficiency percentages to reflect your own abilities.

- **Contact Section**

  Provide a way for visitors to contact you, such as your email and LinkedIn profile.

<a href="https://twitter.com/yourprofile"><i class="bi bi-twitter"></i></a>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"><i class="bi bi-linkedin"></i></a>
<a href="https://github.com/yourusername"><i class="bi bi-github"></i></a>
<!-- Add or remove social icons as needed -->
```

### **5. Modify Skills and Proficiency**

In the skills section, update the skill names and proficiency levels:

```html
<div class="progress">
  <span class="skill"><span>JavaScript</span> <i class="val">80%</i></span>
  <div class="progress-bar-wrap">
    <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="80" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### **6. Update Projects Section**

Each project is contained within a `div` with the class `portfolio-item`. Update or add new projects:

```html
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 portfolio-item">
  <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject" target="_blank">
    <img src="assets/img/projects/yourproject.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Project Title">
  </a>
  <div class="portfolio-info">
    <h4>Project Title</h4>
    <p>Short description of the project.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### **7. Update Blogs Section**

If you have blog posts, update the blogs section accordingly:

```html
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
  <div class="blog-item">
    <a href="https://yourbloglink.com/post" target="_blank">
      <img src="assets/img/blogs/blog1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Blog Post Title">
    </a>
    <div class="blog-info">
      <h4>Blog Post Title</h4>
      <p>Short summary of the blog post.</p>
      <a href="https://yourbloglink.com/post" target="_blank" class="read-more">Read More</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### **8. Update Certifications and Awards**

Customize the certifications and awards sections by updating the content and links:

**Certifications:**

```html
<div class="service-item position-relative">
  <a href="https://certificationlink.com" target="_blank" class="stretched-link">
    <h3>Certification Title</h3>
  </a>
  <p>Description of the certification.</p>
</div>
```

**Awards:**

```html
<div class="swiper-slide">
  <div class="testimonial-item">
    <div class="row gy-4 justify-content-center">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="testimonial-content">
          <h3>Award Title</h3>
          <p>Description of the award.</p>
          <a href="https://awardlink.com" target="_blank">Learn More</a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### **9. Replace the Favicon**

Replace `assets/img/favicon.png` and `assets/img/apple-touch-icon.png` with your own favicon images.

## Deployment

Once you have customized your portfolio, you can deploy it using GitHub Pages.

### **Deploying to GitHub Pages**

GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. There are two types of GitHub Pages sites:

- **User or Organization Site**: Hosted at `https://your-username.github.io/`.
- **Project Site**: Hosted at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

#### **Option 1: User or Organization Site**

To deploy your portfolio as a user site:

1. **Repository Naming**

   - **Important**: The repository must be named exactly `your-username.github.io`, where `your-username` is your GitHub username.

     For example, if your username is `johndoe`, the repository name should be `johndoe.github.io`.

2. **Create the Repository**

   - If you haven't already, create a new repository named `your-username.github.io`.

   - You can do this by renaming your forked repository or by creating a new one and copying your customized files into it.

3. **Push Your Code**

   - Ensure all your changes are committed.

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Customize portfolio"
     ```

   - Push your changes to the `main` branch:

     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Access Your Portfolio**

   - After a few minutes, your portfolio will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/`.

#### **Option 2: Project Site**

If you prefer to deploy your portfolio as a project site within a repository:

1. **Repository Naming**

   - You can name your repository anything you like (e.g., `portfolio`).

2. **Push Your Code**

   - Ensure all your changes are committed and pushed to the repository.

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Customize portfolio"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**

   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on **Settings**.
   - Navigate to the **Pages** section on the left sidebar.
   - Under **Source**, select the branch you want to use (e.g., `main`) and select the folder `/ (root)` or `/docs` if your site is in the `docs` folder.
   - Click **Save**.

4. **Update URLs in Your HTML**

   - Since your project site will be hosted under `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`, you need to update the paths to your assets (CSS, JS, images) in `index.html` and other HTML files.

   - Alternatively, you can set the `base` tag in your `index.html` head section:

     ```html
     <head>
       <base href="/your-repo-name/">
       <!-- ... rest of your head content ... -->
     </head>
     ```

   - This ensures all relative URLs are resolved correctly.

5. **Access Your Portfolio**

   - After a few minutes, your portfolio will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

**Note:** For project sites, remember that asset paths may need to be adjusted due to the additional `/your-repo-name/` path segment.
